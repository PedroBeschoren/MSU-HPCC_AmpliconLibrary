#a few handy Bash commands for simple checks

# Count sequencs in a *.fastq file
echo $(cat *.fastq|wc -l)/4|bc

# count sequencs in *.fasta file
grep -c "^>" *.fasta

# check number of reads per sequence size in a *.fastq file
awk 'NR%4 == 2 {lengths[length($0)]++} END {for (l in lengths) {print l, lengths[l]}}' *.fastq
